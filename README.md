# NVIDIA Re-IdentificationNet with Digital Twin Technology
This project, aims to leverage cutting-edge NVIDIA technologies, particularly NVIDIA Omniverse and its Replicator, to develop a robust re-identification model alongside an object detection system optimized for edge devices. A key aspect of this endeavor is the strategic use of synthetic data, generated within realistic digital twin environments, to overcome the limitations of real-world data collection and annotation, thereby enabling more efficient and scalable training of the AI models for deployment in resource-constrained edge computing scenarios.
